# LeapMotionEscapeRoom
An "escape room" videogame developed in Unity using only the Leap Motion device as input.
It was my first job on a videogame and above all it is not a videogame developed for commercial purposes but only as a thesis project for my degree in computer science (October 2016-February 2017) and to start working on a videogame.
There is a demonstration video in "VideoOfGame" folder.
