# LeapMotionEscapeRoom
An "escape room" videogame developed in Unity using only the Leap Motion device as input.
It was my first job on a video game and above all it is not a videogame developed for commercial purposes but only as a thesis project for my degree in computer science (October 2016-February 2017).
